# What is this?

**I'm a completely noob coder, if my code have anything inappropriate, please tell me.* *
# How to use?
The programme will create a config file and log file automatically, so I suggest you put the program into a folder before running it.  

Download the file from the [release](/release), put it in a folder and the program is ready.   

Before you start, make sure you are in the same network as the other device. After you start the program, you should be able to see you IP address and the port each function will be on through the interface. Start the functions and open (IP address):(port) on the other devices' browser and follow the instructions on the website.

There should be three buttons in the bottom of the interface, click them each to use the functions. Settings can be accessed through `Config` button.

Don't forget to set the save path for the file you received, if you did not set this, __I can't promise there won't be anything wrong with the program__. You could see the output of the program throuth the log file.

**Again, I am a completely noob programmer, if there is any BUG with the program or there's anything I can do to improve this program, please tell me and I will try my best.* *
